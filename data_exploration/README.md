# Data Exploration
This analysis relies on data downloaded from the [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).

### Running Notebook
This exploration relies on Spark for loading JSON data and running analysis in a Jupyter Notebook.
You can run PySpark in a Notebook like so:
```
$ export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=jupyter
$ export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS='notebook'
$ pyspark
```
